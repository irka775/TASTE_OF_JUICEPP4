## User Experience Design

- **Site Goals**:

  - Targeted at juice lovers and food enthusiasts.
  - Promote health through the use of natural ingredients.
  - Provide a vibrant, engaging platform for sharing culinary experiences.

- **Agile Planning**:
  - User stories were managed using a GitHub project board.
  - Features were prioritized using the MoSCoW method:
    - **Must Have**: Essential features like user authentication, recipe CRUD operations.
    - **Should Have**: Features like recipe search, pagination, and comments.
    - **Could Have**: Additional enhancements like advanced search options, social media logins.
    - **Won't Have**: Features considered for future implementation if time permits.

## The Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

The website is aimed for everyone who loves Juices and exploring cuisines from all around the globe. The site also aims at people who are simply searching for an inspiration on days when they simply want to try something new and discover a diverse recipes. The application aims to provide a vibrant and engaging platform for food enthusiasts to explore, share and indulge in culinary delights.

### Agile Planning

I employed the Agile methodology and utilized a GitHub project board to organize and develop my user stories starting from the project planning stage and continuing until the final product was built. To enhance clarity and structure, a user story template is designed that precisely outlines each user story with an acceptance criteria to be fulfilled.

- All User Stories include:
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Labels (MoSCoW Prioritization)
- Labels have been used to mark which features the project : 'must have', 'should have', 'could have'. The prioritization was done so that a MVP for the project is created in time I have and only focus on the 'should haves' or 'could haves' if the time allows.
- Each User story was checked for the acceptance criteria have been met and closed.

- The detailed Project Board with all user stories can be found here. [PROJECT BOARD-link](https://github.com/users/irka775/projects/8)

#### Issues

- **1 - Initial Project Setup:**
  The first task in starting the project was to setup it up. All the tasks from setting up github repository to installing django, setting up django app and related packages . The acceptance criteria was refined for each of the setup to be completed for clarity and ease of understanding.

- **2 - User Authentication:**
  This milestone covers user authentication and authorization i.e. user login and logout so that user can explore complete features and functionality of the website.

- **3 - Recipe Post Functions:**
  All the CRUD functionality and features related to recipes,comments is included here.

- **4 - User Interface Design (UX/UI):**
  The website to be user-friendly and responsive on all devices, this milestone covers the styling aspects of the site, from website pagination to responsiveness and error pages so that user has smooth experience throughout the application.

- **5 - Admin Functionality:**
  Includes admin dashboard functionality so that admin can monitor the website for users, recipes and comments. This milestone was included to keep the admin and site user functionality separate for clarity.

- **6 - Final Project Deployment:**
  Included as it was absolutely necessary and important to have a live link of fully functional website with no errors so that everyone can have access to the application.

### Database Design

![Entity-Relationship-Diagram](documentation/docs_images/entity-relationship-diagram.png)

- The database ER diagram was designed using [SmartDraw](https://www.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/). The main Recipe model contains all the fields needed for the recipe to be complete. Additional fields (like category, nutritional value, meals type., etc) can be added to further enhance the website, but the values are not vital for the site to work and can be added later.
- The diagram shows relationaships between the Recipe model, Comments Model and django's allauth User model as follows:

  1.  User to Recipe: One-to-Many (1:M)
      - Each user can create multiple recipes.
      - Each recipe is created by one user.
  2.  Recipe to Comment: One-to-Many (1:M)
      - Each recipe can have multiple comments.
      - Each comment is associated with one recipe.
  3.  User to Comment: One-to-Many (1:M)
      - Each user can make multiple comments.
      - Each comment is made by one user.

- In summary, User can create multiple recipes, and each recipe is associated with one user. Recipe can have multiple comments, and each comment is associated with one recipe. User can make multiple comments, and each comment is made by one user.
- These relationships was implemented using ForeignKey fields in the models. The Recipe model have a ForeignKey field referencing the User model to represent the creator of the recipe, and the Comment model have ForeignKey fields referencing both the Recipe model and the User model to represent the recipe being commented on and the user making the comment, respectively.

## The Surface Plane

### Design

The website uses clean, simple design with earthy colours and images that showcases the primary goal of the website. The aim here was to keep the site clutter-free so that user can have a smooth straight-forward navigation experience throughout without any chaos and confusion.

#### Typography

- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?query=oswald) was chosen for logo and headings as it can be combined easily with other fonts. It is attractive and amenable for the heading content on site. Because it is slightly elongated, it brings contrast to a typography combination. With website consideration it was best suited as it gives both modern and a serious touch to the content throughout on pages.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato) was chosen for body text as it is light and easy to read.

#### Images

- The images in this project are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). They were specifically selected to correlate with the main purpose of the website and to give user a imagery representation for the recipe content to increase impact of the design.

## Technologies

### Tools and Technologies

## Testing

### Responsiveness

- The site is designed to be flexible, fluid and responsive on all screen sizes. Website has been checked for responsiveness through Chrome Development tools. In order to do this, the following steps have been taken:

  1. Open the browser.
  2. Navigate to the Taste juice website <https://Taste-juice-4b4d80fd4040.herokuapp.com/>
  3. Right click anywhere on the page and got to "Inspect" to open Development Tools.
  4. Click on drop down menu: "Dimensions: Responsive" and choose "Responsive".
  5. Drag the side of the screen and change screen size, making sure the website looks good from 320px and up. Here, ensure there is consistency in design of the website on every screen size from small(mobile devices) to larger(desktop devices) and no scorll bar is showing for layout of site.

- Expected Result: Each page is responsive and user friendly when viewing the website on small and large screens.The pages have no design or accessibility issue in any of the screen sizes from 320px and up.
- Actual Result: Website is responsive with no scroll bar showing, the content is accessible to user to read and the images are not appearing stretched. Website is user friendly on small to large screen sizes.

- The following devices are used to check responsiveness:
  - Iphone 12 Pro
  - Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
  - iPad Mini
  - Surface Pro 7
- The website was also tested further by sharing the live link with friends and family. The site was tested on following devices:

  - Samsung S20 FE 5G
  - Iphone 12
  - iPad Air
  - Samsung S24 Ultra
  - Microsoft Surface
  - Asus X5 50
  - Lenovo Pad Pro 12.7

- The following browsers have been used to check responsiveness. Testing for different browsers was carried on using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) and manually on some of the browsers.
  - Chrome
  - Safari
  - Microsoft Edge
  - Firefox
  - Internet Explorer

### Accessibility

- Each page is checked with the help of WAVE Accessibility tool (<https://wave.webaim.org/>)
- Each page passes accessibility test with no error for:

  - contrast
  - aria- labels for users who use screen-readers.
  - alternative text as a function for screen readers or in events if the images don't load.
  - structural elements: for users of assistive technology as well as visual and semantic meaning.
  - language of the document for screen readers.
  - an alert coming up 'Reduntant link-Adjacent links go to the same URL', however as it doesn't come up as an error, I have left it in' This is due to page logo and Home page having the same destination link.
  - an alert is coming up 'same alternative text to nearby images' in recipes list view, as the alt is given default in the code, the user uploaded images appear with same alternative text, the solution for this can be adding an image alt field to model, so that the alternative text for image is added by user. I have left it in for later.
  - for errors see the [Bugs](#bugs) section.

## Validator Testing

### HTML Validation

All pages have been run through the [W3C VALIDATOR](https://validator.w3.org/).

In order to check HTML code in dynamic website:

- go to the live page
- click right and select 'Inspect' then click right and select 'View page source'
- code will open in new tab - copy the code
- paste the code in the validator as 'direct input'

#### Home Page

![home-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/home-page-html-validation.png)

#### Recipes Page

![recipes-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/recipes-page-html-validation.png)

#### Recipe Details Page

![recipes-details-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/recipe-detail-page-html-validation.png)

#### Search Recipes Page

#### Delete Recipe Page

![delete-recipe-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/delete-recipe-page-html-validation.png)

#### Add Recipe Page | Update Recipe Page

All errors listed by W3Validator are related to Summernote, and not any code written by me. Errors are the same for both "Add Recipe" page and "Update Recipe" page. Research conducted within the Code Institute community indicates that this is a common occurrence, and therefore it should be noted. However, no action needs to be taken in response.

![add-recipe-html-validation-error](documentation/docs_images/add-recipe-page-error-html-validation.png)

  </details>

#### Sign Up Page

The Sign Up page HTML code is part of the Django authentication form, and I could find no way to change it.
The html errors are coming from Django forms interpretation of allauths helper text, and not any code written by me. So, no action is taken in response.

### Python Validation

No errors were found when passing each file through [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

![python-validation-check](documentation/docs_images/python-ci-linter-validation.png)

Couple of warnings when running settings.py file. Too long lines of code. Modifying the file for resolving the warnings rendered errors during deployment. I have left the mentioned lines in settings.py file unchanged for warnings. All other python files have passed the validation with no errors.

## Automated Testing

### Unit Testing

No unit testing performed at this stage.

## Bugs

- Midway during development I modified my recipe model for slug field which resulted in IntegrityError for previously uploaded recipes. On discussion with tutor, the previous migrations were reversed and new migartions were made to resolve the error.
- Installing both whitenoise and cloudinary resulted in conflict for serving static files and as a result the deployment failed.
  - Fix: The order of apps in my Installed Apps in settings.py for cloudinary was not correct. The apps are reorder correctly, Whitenoise and related staticfiles folder is removed. Static files are served on Cloudinary.

### Unfixed Bugs

- The edit recipe form is fully functional and the recipe is updated successfully, but the image link for "currently" field is not displayed as it should be. The field for previous uploaded / default image placeholder in the update form remains empty. This has resulted in empty link error during wave accessibility test. The quick fix was to use {{ form.as_p }} and render django form as paragraph rather than crispy ones. This fix works but caused the layout issue and the website was not responsive. Due to time constraint, the bug is left unattained. The update functionality though works as expected.

![edit-page-placeholder-bug](documentation/docs_images/recipe-edit%20placeholder.png)

- While testing the website on BrowserStack, an accessibility issue not really a bug is noticed for the like icon. On every other device the like icon displays as expected. But in case of iphone and ipad, the icon appears as expected when viewed by unauthorised users. The like icon however appears transparent to the logged-in users. The functionality though is not affected and like button works properly.

![like-icon-ipad-bug](documentation/docs_images/bug-ipad-air.png)

## Deployment

### Version Control

- The website was developed through Gitpod.

- Code has been pushed to repository on Github with following git commands:

  - git add . - to add files ready to commit
  - git commit -m "message" - to commit the code to local repository ready to be pushed
  - git push - final command used to push committed code to remote repo on Github

### Deployment In Heroku

- The project has been deployed on Heroku as follows:
  - Use: pip freeze > requirements.txt to add external libraries to deployed app.
  - Create Heroku account
  - In the top right, click 'New'
  - Click 'Create new app'
  - Give your app a name and select your region from drop down
  - Click 'Create new app'
  - Go to 'settings' tab, it's important you do it before deployment
  - Scroll down to 'config vars' section and key:
    - PORT and value: 8000
    - CLOUDINARY_URL: 'API key to your cloudinary account'
    - DATABASE_URL : 'URL from your database account'
    - SECRET_KEY: 'Generate your own secret key'
  - Scroll down to 'Buildpacks' section
  - Click 'Add buildpack'
  - Add Python as first dependency and select 'Save changes'
  - Add node.js as a second dependency and save again (This is settings section done)
  - Select 'Deploy' tab at the top
  - Select 'Github' from 'Deployment method'
  - type the name of how you called project in Github and click 'search'
  - Scroll down and select manual deployment method
  - You can also use Auto deployment method to allow the project to update every time you push the code.
  - You can now click to view the app ready and running
- For this project I used Manual deployment method to deploy the current state of the branch, every time I pushed the code from Gitpod.

### Cloning the Repository

1. On Github navigate to the repository
2. Click "Code" drop down menu - a green button shown right above the file list.
3. Copy the URL of the repository using "HTTPS", "SSH" or "Github CLI".
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL copied earlier.
7. Press enter to create local clone. A clone of the repository will now be created.

For more details on how to clone the repository in order to create a copy for own use refer to the site: <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>

### Forking

1. On Github navigate to the repository.
2. Click "Fork" located towards top right corner on GitHub page.
3. Select "owner" for the forked repository from the dropdown menu under "owner".
4. It will create forked repo under the same name as original by default. But you can type a name in "Repository name" or add a description in "Description" box.
5. Click on "Create fork". A forked repo is created.

- Forking allows you to make any changes without affecting original project. You can send the the suggestions by submitting a pull request. Then the Project Owner can review the pull request before accepting the suggestions and merging them.
- When you have fork to a repository, you don't have access to files locally on your device, for getting
  access you will need to clone the forked repository.
- For more details on how to fork the repo, in order to for example suggest any changes to the project you can visit:<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>
